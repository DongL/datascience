An useful short video introdution/guide is provided [here](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/introducing-blogdown/).The website will be hosted by github webiste and administered using Netfily.com server. Some basic background knowledges may involve: 

- [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
- Github account 
- [Git1](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/files/git_cheat_sheet.pdf)
- [Git2](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet)
- [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)

## Set up a new repository on github
The `Github.com` is where you will upload and store all the static documents for your website. Suppose you have already set up a github account. The creation of a new repository is straightforward, nothing other than inputting some basic repository info. (e.g. your repository name, public, *etc*).

## Make a local clone
We now make a copy of the github repository to our local directory. Just copy the repository clone HTTPS address as follows:
![ ](/post/2018-12-01-getting-started_files/Screen Shot 2018-12-01 at 5.25.36 PM.png)

Open your terminal and type: 

```
git clone [repository clone HTTPS address]
cd \your\local\dir
```
After downloding the git clone, you should see an empty folder with a folder name the same as the repository name.  

## Set up Rstudio 
Rstudio provides a preset wizard addin for building a website project - Website using blogdown. This will promote you to choose the theme and document format you'd like to use for blogging. _You should create a blogdown project exactly in the clone directory you just set._

Alternatively, the same results can be attained using the r command `new_site()` via Hugo, which prepares and generates an Hugo website skeleton into the directory locating your git clone copy you just set.

## Write your first post
A new post can be initialized using `new_post()` r command from `blogdown` package. 

```
blogdown::new_post(title, kind = "default", open = interactive(), 
    author = getOption("blogdown.author"), categories = NULL, 
    tags = NULL, date = Sys.Date(), file = NULL, slug = NULL, 
    title_case = getOption("blogdown.title_case"), subdir = getOption("blogdown.subdir", 
        "post"), ext = getOption("blogdown.ext", ".md"))
        
        
# Install a new theme
install_theme("gcushen/hugo-academic", theme_example = TRUE, update_config = TRUE)
```

## Push to Github

git add * :/ # adds modified and any new files (that's not gitignore'ed) to the stage
git commit -m 'your commit comment'   # equivalent to save the file
git push origin master # or just git push origin master
```
